                    <p>Hello my name is Amirah Ali, and I believe my true super power is my intuition and the ability to read people.
                         I believe that I have a great ability to be aware of people's moods and emotions, especially when I am close to them.
                        I want to take this class because I love creativity and technology. Growing up I have always had a great sense of technology.
                        I would take apart my toys and small electronics and try to put them back together. After college, I started a small business with 
                        a friend and while running this company, I was in charge of the social media marketing, web designing, graphic designing, and creative directing. 
                        Doing these things really made me realize that my true passion was the things that I was naturally good at, and I decided that I wanted
                        to transition into the tech field!</p>
